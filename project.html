        Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million
        hectares or 545 million acres, 2014).[7] World trade in wheat is greater
        than for all other crops combined.Wheat is an important source of
        carbohydrates.[11] Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable
        proteins in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is
        relatively high compared to other major cereals[13] but relatively low
        in protein quality (supplying essential amino acids).[14][15] When eaten
        as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary
        fiber.
